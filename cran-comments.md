* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is 22.5Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    doc   14.0Mb
    help   3.2Mb
    libs   5.0Mb
    
  This is due to usage of the rather large C++ library vinecopulib provided by
  the CRAN package rvinecopulib in order to facilitate the novel conditional
  sampling algorithms.
