\title{Estimate the Expected Shortfall (ES)}
\usage{
est_es(sample, alpha, method = c("mean", "median", "mc"), mc_samples = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample}{numeric vector representing the sample upon which the expected
shortfall is calculated.}

\item{alpha}{numeric vector with entries in (0,1) specifying the levels at
which the ES is calculated}

\item{method}{method of estimation one of \code{mean}, \code{median}, \code{mc}. For more
information see the Description section.}

\item{mc_samples}{Number of Monte Carlo samples used for the \code{mc} method.}
}
\value{
numeric vector with expected shortfall estimates
(same length as \code{alpha})
}
\description{
The expected shortfall at level \eqn{\alpha} is defined as the expected value
of the returns under the condition that the returns are smaller than the
value at risk for the same \eqn{\alpha} level.
The three estimation methods are:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean} the mean of the samples that fall under the corresponding VaR
\item \code{median} the median of the samples that fall under the corresponding VaR
\item \code{mc} Calculation of the expected value using Monte Carlo integration over
the \eqn{\alpha} levels. The confidence level is assumed to be uniformly
distributed and \code{mc_samples} Monte Carlo samples are drawn.
